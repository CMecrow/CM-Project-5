As a developer, I've been tasked with creating an ecommerse site for a skateshop.

This project has been made using Django / Python, HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Project Goals

## User Stories

The created user stories can be organised into the following epics:

- User & Admin accounts
- Admin product management
- Product display and filtering
- Shopping basket and payment system
- User engagement points, social media / newsletter
- User questions

These epics can then be broken down further into individual user stories:

- User & Admin accounts
    - Account registration
    - Store customer details
    - Edit and update my saved information
    - View order history

- Admin product management
    - Add a new product
    - Edit an existing product
    - Remove a product from the store

- Product display and filtering
    - Site pagination
    - Selecting a category of product
    - Searchbar
    - Viewing an individual product
    - Selecting a size of product

- Shopping basket and payment system
    - Adding a product to the basket
    - Edit quantity and remove products in the basket
    - View a checkout page
    - Complete payment
    - Order confirmation

- User engagement points, social media / newsletter
    - Find the company's social media accounts
    - Sign up to a newsletter

- User questions
    - Post a question about a specific product
    - Answer user questions

These user stories were added to a kanabn board created in Projects in Github. The kanban board contains four columns:
- Backlog: This is where user stories that may not be added in this iteration of the project are kept.
- Todo: Where all essential user stories that have not yet been worked on are stored.
- In Progress: Where all user stories that are currently being worked on are located.
- Done: All completed user stories.
