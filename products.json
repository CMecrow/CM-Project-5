A 62mm wheel with an elliptical profile is not currently being produced anywhere else.\r\n\r\nWe felt the 62's carried their speed well enough without compromising too much on acceleration. We created the urethane a little harder than our previous wheels so they are faster. The small core still allows for enough give in the urethane to create a good 'footprint' (for grip) and shock absorption.\r\n\r\nWe spent the best part of a year testing new materials for the hub. We managed to fully extract the colour pigmentation out of the core this time leaving us with a stronger hub material. We also changed the way the hub is bonded to the urethane 'tyre' so the wheel is now more resistant to de-coring. That said, the wheels have a 1 year warranty against de-coring and core fracturing incase you find an anomaly!\r\n\r\nWith a recent trend towards larger elliptical shaped wheels, the industry has been left with a graveyard of smaller and flatter wheel moulds.
